gmail-mirror

This program uses IMAP to download mail from GMail into local
Maildir-format mailboxes. It tries to cope with interruptions
gracefully, and picks up downloading where it left off.

See http://toroid.org/ams/etc/gmail-imap-mirror for more details.

You may use, modify, or redistribute this program freely, but please
retain the copyright notice, and clearly identify modified versions
as being different from the original. There is no warranty.

Feedback is welcome.
